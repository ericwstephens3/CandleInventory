Fixes that need to be implemented:
  -fix the showing of data from the mySQL database. Currently the data is grabbed successfully but is not shown in the fragment
   Fragment may need to be turned into an activity and done that way


Features that need to be implemented
  -Editing of inventory that is already in the database
  -Removing an entry from the database entirely
